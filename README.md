## ðŸ“– Abstract

This research provides a systematic, empirical evaluation of two primary instructional modalitiesâ€”on-the-fly prompt engineering and persistent, project-level rulesâ€”for guiding AI coding agents to produce accessible Android applications with Jetpack Compose. The study analyzes 84 code artifacts generated by an AI agent under four distinct experimental conditions to measure the impact of these techniques on both code validity and accessibility quality.

The findings reveal a critical trade-off between the reliability of code generation and the quality of the output. The study proposes a "Floor vs. Ceiling" conceptual model, arguing that a dual-instruction strategy, combining the strengths of both rules and prompts, is the most effective method for achieving high-quality, accessible outcomes.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository & Workflow Structure

This repository uses a Git-based workflow to ensure the integrity and replicability of the experiment, as detailed in the dissertation's methodology. The structure is defined by its key branches and tags:

*   **`main` branch:** This branch contains the clean, foundational Android Studio project. It serves as the starting point for every experimental run.

*   **Generation Commits (via Tags):** Each of the 84 experimental runs is isolated in its own commit, identified by a unique Git tag. The tags follow a consistent naming convention: `T-{TaskID}_C{ConditionID}_R{RepetitionID}`.
    *   Example: `T-C1_C4_R2` refers to the **T**ask **C1**, under **C**ondition **4** (Combined), for the **2**nd **R**epetition.

*   **`analysis` branch:** This is a long-lived branch containing all the necessary infrastructure for testing, including the jUnit test files and dependencies required to perform the automated and manual accessibility analyses.

## ðŸ”¬ How to Analyze the Findings

This section provides the step-by-step process to replicate the analysis for any of the 84 experimental runs.

### Prerequisites

The experiment was conducted with a specific, version-locked set of tools to ensure consistency.
*   **AI Agent:** Cline (Version 3.20)
*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (Version 1.102.1)
*   **LLM:** `deepseek-v3`
*   **Android Development:**
    *   Android Studio (Hedgehog or newer)
    *   Java 17
    *   Jetpack Compose BOM: `2025.07.00`
    *   Android Gradle Plugin: `8.11.1`

### Analysis Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **View all experimental runs:**
    To see the list of all 84 unique tags for each generation, run:
    ```bash
    git tag
    ```

3.  **Prepare the analysis environment:**
    Check out the `analysis` branch. This branch contains all the testing code.
    ```bash
    git checkout analysis
    ```

4.  **Merge a specific experiment for testing:**
    Choose any tag from the list and merge it into your local `analysis` branch. This will bring the AI-generated code into the testing environment. For example, to analyze Task T-S2 under the Baseline condition (repetition 1):
    ```bash
    git merge T-S2_C1_R1
    ```

5.  **Run the analysis:**
    *   Open the entire project folder (`your-repository-name`) in Android Studio.
    *   Android Studio will now show the project with the generated code from the merged tag.
    *   Navigate to the relevant test file within the `app/src/androidTest` directory and run the jUnit tests to perform the automated accessibility checks.
    *   Run the app on an emulator or device to perform manual testing with TalkBack.

To analyze another run, you can reset the branch and merge a different tag:
```bash
git reset --hard origin/analysis
git merge <another-tag>
```
